First, make sure your idea is useful, it relates to this directory, and it has never been suggested.

1. Describe as precisely as possible what problem your idea will solve.

2. Describe how you imagine the solution. You can add a piece of code, or a UI/UX template.

Don't hesitate to contribute to the project by making a fork and a pull request linked to your issue.
Report that you are working on it so that others do not do the same thing twice.
