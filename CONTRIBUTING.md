## Code Style

Our code style is maintained by NPM dependencies such as Prettier, Stylelint and Eslint. Please run `npm run build` before committing.

## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

The goal of issues is to help maintainers to understand as quickly and easily as possible your report, this should include as many details as possible.

To submit a good issue, please follow these steps:
